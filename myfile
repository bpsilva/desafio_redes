lyrics:
Let me tell you a story to chill the bones about a things that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades. I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight. Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me. Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees. As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place. And that is where I fell from grace
